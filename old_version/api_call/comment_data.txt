She was a good science graduate and seemed to know what she was talking about (she was hobby botanist).  \n\nPlants showing signs of disease not being quarantined properly, ignoring her warnings about it and diminishing her ability (\"you're just a worker\" - although she had her masters), until eventually that section of plants disappeared one day (aka they listened but didn't listen). Bunch of stoners working the floor, proud of how high they could be while working. Floor manager (or whomever she was talking about) was an inexperienced jerk. Basically she thought they were not knowledgeable at all and eventually going to fuck up majorly.  \n\nPressed her a bit on it one day and found out it was CannTrust she worked for.  \"Oh... I have stock in that company..\".  Took me a couple months to decide to bail, as her stories had made me too afraid they were true.\n\nNow, I don't know which facility she worked at. I don't know how big it was or any names of people.  We lived in the Niagara region, so in my head I always assumed it was the Pelham location.  \n\nWhether any of her shit was true or not, it was enough to get me to sell.  Seeing all this happen now (not necessarily related to her specific experiences) just kind of fills me with regret that I wasn't able to tell other people or warn them that hey, maybe this company is being mismanaged or something.  This is all anecdotal and I knew I'd just sound like someone trying to influence this subreddit one way or another.  I guess this comment too is kind of jumping the gun, as TRST is still a company and perhaps they have some value still.  I don't know.

The Globe's David Leeder writes in the Eye On Equities column that Mr. Gilmer says in a note: \"Based on our view of sales trends across the provinces that have not demonstrated the growth that was initially expected we have lowered our Q3 revenue estimate to $28.5-million representing 6-per-cent growth over the prior quarter. We have also made some small tweaks to our model that drives our EBITDA estimate for the quarter at $11.1-million.\" Mr. Gilmer maintained a \"buy\" rating and share target $13.50. Analysts on average target the shares at $11.98. Mr. Gilmer adds: \"We reiterate Organigram as our top pick in the cannabis sector as the Company continues to execute on its strategic vision. We have made some small revisions to our estimates for Q3 and Q4 of Organigram's fiscal 2019.

There are too many other names that don\u2019t (or haven\u2019t been caught). Why would HC grant their pending outdoor license now? We know that for sure their next two quarters will suffer from lost supply and potentially having to buy to fill supply. We also know that extent of the damage isn\u2019t fully known. The late day announcement that at least some illegal grow was already shipped suggests a smouldering dumpster fire. And the early day insinuation that illegal activity was the fault of employees rather than management (ie one forward action will be better employee training) suggests management are assholes (that we already knew with a $5.50 raise to ensure short term tanking of the stock) or so totally inept that they didn\u2019t know employees planted, maintained, harvested, processed, and apparently sold and shipped product. Either way not great.\n\nTiming is so bad as they were about to hit total bottom of their cycle right before a fall run into edibles. As someone else said at $3.50 PT is pretty bad. Even worse when BoA-ML was one of the underwriters of that $5.50 raise. They\u2019re pegging their own target at almost a 50% drop.

If we could we'd all be rich\n\n1) Sell tomorrow at a 70%+ loss (we both know it's going down further) and don't beat yourself up over it because no DD can predict shit like this. Take that money and reinvest it into something that you think will make money to make up the difference\n\n2) Hold through the bad time. If you have faith in their actual business outside of this nonsense, then you should have faith that they will recover from this. Just make sure to lower your expectations from what they were before, and don't worry about the day to day price - you will be holding long so why worry about short term\n\nIf you were at a 65% loss, you're not going to see break even in 2019 even with bull runs at the end of the year, at least in my opinion, so maybe that's something to not necessarily base a decision on. \"Should I hold to break even\" is what a lot of us feel and in a situation like this, where it drops 25% in a day with no positive news to get it back green, it's going to take time to restore investor confidence\n\nEarlier in the day I was adamant on holding because a 25% drop at open seemed like a huge overreaction despite how bad the news was - it should have dropped but over DAYS not one day. After the news came out later in the day about illegal goods being shipped, I kind of swayed on my stance and sold all my shares at a $1300 loss (60%). TRST was a good chunk of my portfolio, I'm not out here playing with 30k+. To me, TRST isn't going to go upwards from here in the near future all that much, there's no real incentive to buy unless you believe there will be no repercussions from this, you know? So to hope you will get back to break even is a pipe dream right now, throw that out of your mind when you make the call\n\n\nTo me at this point, if you're in touch with the sector, start thinking about other plays you could funnel that money into that would make money instead of continuing to lose money until this all washes over. Or at the very least go cash and rebuy lower. There's not a chance we see green tomorrow. If there was buying action near EOD I'd say otherwise but there was none, it dropped further. Use it as a tax write off and hopefully make up some of that money elsewhere. There are too many companies with less risk to put that money into that could grow from here vs TRST who has a much more uphill battle. You don't want to sell bc you see the loss, but when you kind of sit there and realize that money isn't coming back anytime soon anyway, it's less painful.\n\nWhatever you do, remember that everyone who gives you advice has an agenda.
