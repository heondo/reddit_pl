I will be back on Friday at 2:30\n\nPDT to answer your questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt has been a few months since we introduced 1933 Industries to the Reddit community\n\nand Brayden Sutton, former CEO of the company, did a great job answering all your\n\nquestions. I will endeavour to do the same. A little bit of background about myself, I have\n\nbeen passionate about bringing organic wellness to people for years and started Infused\n\nManufacturing (Infused) with this goal in mind. I previously worked in cosmetic\n\nmanufacturing and took that knowledge into the cannabis industry. After much trial and\n\nerror, I personally developed the formulas for our Canna Hemp\u2122 wellness line, which is\n\nnow sold across the US in over 800 retail outlets. Our products are actually improving\n\npeople\u2019s lives and I couldn\u2019t be more excited and proud! I was recently appointed CEO of\n\n1933 Industries, overseeing the growth of this company. I am repositioning our business to\n\nbe brand-centric - in essence creating a true house of brands with assets to support it. Here\n\nare some of the finer details about our company:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are a publicly traded issuer on the Canadian Securities Exchange and in the US on the\n\nOTC\u2019s premier tier QX (CSE:TGIF, OTCQX: TGIFF). Our assets are based in Las Vegas,\n\nNevada where we essentially own the market. As wholesalers of cannabis flower and\n\nconcentrates, our products are carried in all dispensaries in the Nevada market, owning\n\napprox. 7% share of the market. Las Vegas is one of the largest recreational cannabis\n\nmarkets in the world with approx. 45 million visitors per year. Our hemp-based, CBD\n\nproducts can be shipped outside of state and this is where we see a huge growth\n\nopportunity for our company. When we went public in 2017, both our THC and CBD assets\n\nwere small and constricted by our current infrastructure, which is why we undertook a\n\nmassive cultivation expansion project which is now ready. We are moving into a purpose-\n\nbuilt, almost 70,000 sq. ft. building, where we expect to achieve a 5x increase in cannabis\n\ncultivation to provide the raw materials for our flower and branded concentrate lines sold\n\nunder the Alternative Medicine Association (AMA) name. Infused also moved into an\n\nexpanded warehouse to accommodate larger inventory and shipping across the US. Our\n\nCanna Hemp\u2122 brand is experiencing huge growth, which is directly attributed to the\n\nsuperior quality of our products. We consistently receive rave reviews from third parties,\n\nincluding industry professionals and customers and believe that our products are\n\ndisrupting the beauty and wellness sectors. As the public becomes knowledgeable about\n\nthe science behind CBD and hterpenes, we believe that this will be an explosive market. At\n\nCanna Hemp\u2122, we design products with specific demographics in mind. We have products\n\nthat aid in relieving everything from muscle aches and sores to nerve pain and migraines.\n\nWe developed a line for athletes, including CBD elixirs aimed at workout preparation and\n\nrecovery as well as our award winner and top seller Canna Hemp X\u2122 cream for sore\n\nmuscles. In addition, we isolate specific terpenes and mixtures to achieve desired effects. In\n\ntotal, we have over 200 products on both the CBD and THC sides that are available in the\n\nmarket today and our portfolio is growing with the introduction of new products under\n\nlicensing agreements. We see the CBD market as a key component to our business and a\n\nhigh-growth vertical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week we posted $4.6 million in our Q3 financial report for fiscal 2019. For the last nine\n\nmonths ending April 2019, our revenues total almost $13 million. There are a number of\n\ncatalysts for our company over the next several months as we execute on an ambitious\n\ngrowth plan. Our reach continues to grow in terms of both brand recognition, distribution\n\nand sales with the ultimate goal of being a household name, synonymous with proven,\n\nnatural CBD wellness and consumer trust. We are working diligently in getting our hemp\n\nextraction facility up and running by year\u2019s end, adding another vertical to our business.\n\nThe new facility will process hemp biomass into CBD spectrum oils, distillates and isolates\n\nand more importantly, we will be able to process additional cannabinoids such as CBG, CBC,\n\nCBN, etc. Looking ahead, we will continue to scale up our assets, build the required\n\ninfrastructure to support our brands, continue to penetrate the US market with our Canna\n\nHemp\u2122 portfolio, increase sales and margins, establish the hemp-processing and CBD\n\nextraction vertical, and expand into new markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am here on /r/weedstocks to talk to investors focused on the cannabis sector about our\n\nbusiness and about the industry and will return to answer your questions on Friday, July\n\n12 at 2:30pm PDT. I encourage you to post any questions in advance and I look forward to\n\nengaging the community.

I hope seasoned investors and newcomers both find this post useful. I have been investing for over a year now and have learned a lot. I hope this post will help tame some people's expectations. Admittedly, my expectations were too high when I started investing in this sector (no pun intended). I wish I read a post like this a year ago. This post is for long-term investors, not day traders.\n\nMy general thesis is that there is far too much risk out there. Here's why:\n\n1. Every single weedstock on the market right now is overpriced. Some stocks are VERY overpriced. Assuming that these companies will grow into/past their current valuation is NOT a given. Additionally, stock prices in this sector have been severely limited given the amount of dilution that has occurred with some companies. (Example: ACB).\n\n2. There is a lot of uncertainty in the overall market. If the market goes south, weedstocks will be crushed.\n\n3. Far too much foul play out there. Look at CannTrust, iAnthus, Aphria, etc. This is not the end of this type of bullshit, folks. (If you don't know what I'm referring to, please read up on these companies).\n\n4. Completely nonsensical moves in stock prices. Example: Acreage. Company was essentially sold at 3.4B. It is currently valued at about half of that. Wtf? People who invested on this news have been buttfucked in the short term (let's see what happens long term).\n\n5. It is very early days in this sector. No one knows how things will play out in the future. Many of these companies can very well be nonexistent in 5+ years.\n\n6. It is very risk to believe some of the things written in this sub. Many people are pumping stocks that they know are trash (and are likely being paid to do this). Reading this sub will influence how you feel about certain companies/the overall sector. Do your own DD and make sure you really know what you're doing before putting a lot of money down. Make your decisions based on financial statements and other legitimate sources, not what some shmuck wrote in the Daily thread.\n\nTLDR: Weedstocks are extremely risky given overpriced SPs, shady business practices, and uncertainty regarding how the industry will pan out. Make sure you check your expectations at the door.\n\nEdit: Sorry if I sounded too dramatic. I am still long on several companies. I just think this sector is rife with BS. And for those of you commenting about my bags/losses: yes, I have bags and big losses. I also have some gains. I wrote this post because I do not want others to lose money the way I and many others have. My advice: do not over-allocate your portfolio in weedstocks, and pick only a few high-quality companies. Just my 2 cents.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "weedstocks", "title": "Stop dumping money into weedstocks NOW", "upvote_ratio": 0.31, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/cb8kt2/stop_dumping_money_into_weedstocks_now/"}]
