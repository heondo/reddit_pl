The reward for the company just simply wasn't there compared to the risk. I think the circumstances were that an operations manager was hired to do a job and either over-promised or was handed unrealistic targets, possibly fell behind in some other way, and wanted to make up the lost ground. Things spiraled and they soon became in over their heads to the point where it boiled over and they had to actively try and cover it up, while an ever increasing number of people were getting roped in and involved. What's one plant, two, four, twenty, etc...? Delivering the improved harvest numbers, nobody said anything or noticed, so he figured it was not a big deal he's in the clear. Management assumed their greenhouse operations manager was obviously a wunderkind master grower because look at these freaking yields! He's doing something right, just keep doing what you're doing kid! The true failing of the higher ups is likely a gross lack of oversight. Aceto is handed the keys to the company and he's told he's here to steer the ship and make deals, there are qualified operators already in the appropriate positions. Why would a banker try to get involved and micromanage the facility? I'm sure he did visit on occasion. But how often, for how long, did he visit every room? Does he need a repeat grand tour of his own company's facility each time he's there?\n\n\nI think while certainly a terrible situation, it may very well be the c-suite truly had no knowledge, even if the signs were there in the yield numbers. This is a stark failing, but not criminal on their part. Perhaps Health Canada is going to take it into consideration whether the non-compliance was due to upper management decisions, or a mid-level employee taking it upon himself to beef up his numbers to meet targets and roping his crew into it in the process.\n\n\nCrises like this are always horribly uncomfortable, for not only shareholders of the company, but in the sector as a whole. It's the uncertainty that's killing everyone since management and the board CAN'T extensively comment at this time.

For example, if MMEN is at $6 and has a $6 VWAP when tranche 2 converts, the shares will now convert at $2.55, whereas before they would have converted at $6.90. So MMEN will have to give more than twice as many shares for the money than the previous deal.\n\nWhy did they agree to these revised terms? It can't possibly be because they want $280MM rather than $250MM, but more likely because they need tranche 2 right away. Why is this, when they just got tranche 1 not long ago and they are also selling shares on the open market?\n\nI do not have a short position or puts in this or any company, but the positive reaction to this shitty PR just reminds me so much of some fervent believers in certain Canadian LPs who ended up ignoring red flags and getting burnt.

Look at ASNT\n\nDepends on if you're an investor or trader. As a trader, I'd think anytime you're down 10-20% you should sell out if you think it'll get worse, don't risk it any further than that. If you're a good trader it shouldn't ever get to that point though, but that trading level is above most of our expertise. As an investor you have a little more leeway, but this situation is pretty telling. The only positive news you can really get is that they're not COMPLETELY fucked, is that really positive news?\n\nYou just said \"obviously that's about to get way worse\" - why would you still hold if you assume that? Shit, if you're long on TRST for whatever reason you should exit out now and rebuy lower unless you're worried about long term vs short term gains tax. In the short term you're not going to see a net gain, but if you think you will in the long term my advice would be to selloff and rebuy lower and forget about the taxing of it. The 10% you might save with long term tax might be offset by you rebuying 10%+ lower, you know? Nobody knows where the bottom is or if it can recover - if we did we'd all be rich\n\nAsk yourself this. Can bagholders deal with a third day of -10% and no positive news? Do the amount of people who want to play TRST thinking it will fully recover offset the people who want out? To me, they don't, and that's why I bailed and won't get back in. The company has a stink on it now far worse than any of the major players in the sector ever had (APHA) and while they can recover from it, they could also lose it all. It's a risk to play it or to hold it IMO.\n\n60% loss sucks, but it's better than further loss. The 40% I had left is in cash being held for a good opportunity to invest that elsewhere and chip away at making that 60% back. If you believe in the company and their ability to rebuild from this then average down after you see some upwards movement. It won't go down forever if they don't lose their license, but it also won't go back up 60%+ by the end of the year with this scandal\n\nNow if you're down 90%+?

Until their is a nationally recognized testing protocol, I\u2019m not sure comparing results tells you much.\n\nHave you ever tested flowers at a lab? How about testing batches from rooms yielding hundreds of lbs? When you batch test you can have individual nuggets that test super high, but the sample average will usually be lower. As a company, obviously you promote how strong your flowers are because it\u2019s great for marketing. However, I\u2019m not sure people will justify paying an extra 15% tax for flower just because the state deems it\u2019s over some arbitrary number.\n\nIt seems that most knowledgeable buyers don\u2019t actually purchase flowers based on THC content, they prefer to purchase based on terpenes, bag appeal or \u201cnewness.\u201d Luckily Illinois will have some years where the market gets educated and these products still demand a premium.\n\nAlso we are talking about one flower strain testing high when 99% of any states flower industry will test below 35%. To me this puts concentrates at a unfair disadvantage in this market and will cause people to resort to black market. (I.e - one guy buys a lb of flower at 10% tax rate and rosin presses it for his friends)\n\nAnother way to look at it is this: 20% is a good return on concentrates. Therefore 5g of flower = 1g of concentrate. You are going to have the option of purchasing 5g of flower for $50 at a 10% tax rate. Making the total $55. Alternately you can purchase a gram of concentrate for $60 ($10 more to cover the cost of extraction) which is then taxed at 25%. Making the total $75. This is a rough representation, but I think it makes it clear that rules like this are implemented to stunt certain parts of the industry.
