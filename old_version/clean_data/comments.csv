2high4life,These stupid hang ups are gonna prevent legalization from happening in our life time. Just allow people to grow 3-5 plants in home. Don’t put a limit on the licenses needed to distribute. Don’t allow the same company’s corner the market by owning both grow houses and store fronts. Reduce the cost of a license get rid of the ridiculous application fee. Allow banks to store their funds. Have federal standards for quality. Stop jobs from discriminating future employees with drug screenings that come up positive for weed. And stop worrying about creating a new weed breathalyzer. Cops should be able to tell if the driver is high without new tech. Have a price standard that’s lower then current street value while having a reasonable sales tax that’s not overly greedy. By cutting out transportation fees and multiple middle men there should be enough money for everyone to be happy. They just need to stop being so god damn greedy.

dodgedude780,"This sounds legit. And a little more like a rouge employee to me. If he (the plant manager) was in fact acting solely, being the top dog on that site day to day, I could see this being overlooked. At least the inspection and fake phots and such. there’s many reports and employee reviews citing high turn over from that facility, cease and desist letters to employees and such. C’mon. Wtf,

But 6 for months!?!?

And even Peter on his very first conference call sounded shocked and surprised at the numbers. Audibly asked the CFO “are we missing something?”

And then how that was never looked further into, or that was never questioned by senior management. 

Greed. Greet and self admitted fellatio got them as deep as they are now.

How did nobody from upper management ever catch onto this?


Peter: “Hey their Pelham Facility, it’s Peter here, we’ve got the licences from Health Canada for the last 5 rooms, how long until we can plan for a harvest?”

Pelham Facility: “Ah don’t worry about that Mr.Aceto, harvest should be pretty quick. Our clones are at very late stage in development”

And then what. Over the next 2 months post April licensing they didn’t catch on that the biological growth assets weren’t really climbing?

I’m sorry, bu the plant manager doesn’t handle the numbers in the Ivory Tower.

catsaysmrau,"Taking all this in, what is sticking out like a sore thumb is this:


> Mr. Lalonde said the order to stage the misleading photographs came from a greenhouse operations manager; he said he does not know whether or not the order came from higher up the management chain. 


I am going out on a limb here, but I don't think the orders came from higher up than that. The reward for the company just simply wasn't there compared to the risk. I think the circumstances were that an operations manager was hired to do a job and either over-promised or was handed unrealistic targets, possibly fell behind in some other way, and wanted to make up the lost ground. Things spiraled and they soon became in over their heads to the point where it boiled over and they had to actively try and cover it up, while an ever increasing number of people were getting roped in and involved. What's one plant, two, four, twenty, etc...? Delivering the improved harvest numbers, nobody said anything or noticed, so he figured it was not a big deal he's in the clear. Management assumed their greenhouse operations manager was obviously a wunderkind master grower because look at these freaking yields! He's doing something right, just keep doing what you're doing kid! The true failing of the higher ups is likely a gross lack of oversight. Aceto is handed the keys to the company and he's told he's here to steer the ship and make deals, there are qualified operators already in the appropriate positions. Why would a banker try to get involved and micromanage the facility? I'm sure he did visit on occasion. But how often, for how long, did he visit every room? Does he need a repeat grand tour of his own company's facility each time he's there?


I think while certainly a terrible situation, it may very well be the c-suite truly had no knowledge, even if the signs were there in the yield numbers. This is a stark failing, but not criminal on their part. Perhaps Health Canada is going to take it into consideration whether the non-compliance was due to upper management decisions, or a mid-level employee taking it upon himself to beef up his numbers to meet targets and roping his crew into it in the process.


Crises like this are always horribly uncomfortable, for not only shareholders of the company, but in the sector as a whole. It's the uncertainty that's killing everyone since management and the board CAN'T extensively comment at this time. Their priority is solely purpose right now is dealing with Health Canada, addressing the issues, complying with reports, and trying to rectify the situation, not doing a string of television interviews, press releases, or trickling out information which may raise more questions than it answers if not revealed with full context despite shareholders screaming for it.",1562814750.0,2019-07-11 18:04:36.541537,,1562814961.0,ethgdr7,False,t3_cbopsb,t1_ethc47u,/r/weedstocks/comments/cbopsb/canntrust_used_fake_walls_to_hide_pot_from/ethgdr7/,3,False,weedstocks,t5_2zfqj

> They had to be there maybe once a week, if they were truly nonchalant and don't give a shit? Once every few weeks? It's not as if nobody ever showed up for six months and just let the place run itself. They still have to show up for meetings with lower management on a semi regular basis.

Do they? Since when do executives show up to standard weekly meetings? I've met my actual boss in person once or twice, spoken on the phone a couple times, been working there 4.5 years. Things get delegated, and people are in turn briefed. Can these standard operations meetings not be done entirely remotely as well in this day and age? You hear the ads for Zoom Video Conferencing everywhere!

> You're telling me some mid level manager was able to hide half the fucking facility from every single upper management type above him, and every other manager in the building lateral to his position?

Since you seem to be so well versed in this, how many lateral positions to this person in question were there at the facility?",1562819722.0,2019-07-11 18:04:36.541835,,1562822106.0,ethm6jr,False,t3_cbopsb,t1_ethihiu,/r/weedstocks/comments/cbopsb/canntrust_used_fake_walls_to_hide_pot_from/ethm6jr/,6,False,weedstocks,t5_2zfqj

Dudebro_dope,"90% of this sub shouldn’t even be investing. There’s a real instant gratification “want it right now” mentality, not to mention the negativity. 

If you believe in the industry, then hold and stop stressing about every single movement or article, that’s a perfect way to buy high and sell low. 

I’ve been investing successfully for 12yrs now and will be retiring very early in the next 2yrs. The same old rules apply now: 

- buy companies with large economic moats and/or scale (includes technological advantages) 
- if you aren’t willing to do DD and keep on top of companies you own, buy ETFs
- buy fear, sell euphoria 
- diversify, don’t go balls deep on weed stocks if you can’t afford to lose that money 
- averaging down is not always a good idea, don’t catch a falling knife. 

This is a new industry, but the same investing principles apply.",1562856616.0,2019-07-11 18:04:36.544518,,False,etip4nb,False,t3_cbti6r,t3_cbti6r,/r/weedstocks/comments/cbti6r/rweedstocks_casual_daily_discussion_july_11_2019/etip4nb/,34,False,weedstocks,t5_2zfqj

bigpappy1999," Very well said! Most of the individuals in this sector are under 25 and living at home, playing video games in their parents’ basement. I have made a fortune in this sector the last 4 years and as well leaning towards early retirement in 3-5 years. Most of our society seeks instant gratification like fast food and video games or a line of coke and  the instant high is sorely sought after. Much the angst in this sector by retail investors is caused by the high level of anxiety in our young people. Mobile phones, too much screen time and too much stimulation is a primary factor that have moulded the young mind.

Once I'm out of VFF and OH, I'm leaving this sector and probably not coming back for a long, long time. I'll only stay long on WEED because I'm playing with the house's money.

CD_4M,"I struggled with this on Monday, although I was making this decision only down 46% and at that time the price was $5.05 CAD. For me, the best case looking forward was that TRST would keep their license but need to destroy all the weed grown in the illegal rooms. In that case, the financial performance would definitely suffer and I suspected the share price would stay beaten down for at least a year. The worst case was that criminal charges are laid against management and TRST loses their license, in which case the share price could realistically hit $0. 

Based on that, I decided to pull my money and place it elsewhere, believing that I could find another company that would return 46% before TRST did. In your case, you'd be looking for a place to put your money that would return 76% before TRST does. This is obviously more difficult, but still not impossible given the current state of TRST. The downside risk of further loses from this point is also a very realistic outcome that needs to be considered. 

In any case, I don't want to advise you one way or the other, but hopefully taking you through my thought process from Monday will help you in some way.

LuxGang,"The thing that makes me want to avoid the sector is that none of these companies are truly proven. I'm an investor, not a trader (though I have done a lot of trading in this sector because of the volatility) and I want to know my investment will be ""safe"" in 5-years time. Can't do that in this sector. Things move very fast, and a small mistake or oversight can lead to major losses or bag holding for months.

I've done my DD on VFF and look how hard it's tanking, despite being undervalued compared to peers. They released good news today, and while TRST just had horrible news less than 12 hrs ago, they are down less than VFF. It just makes no sense. 

There's too many traders flipping for 1% and I can't blame them. Again, there's no stability and too much BS happening behind the scenes.

Raptorswon,"I think it's true and evident. Regardless of how Bruce's tenured ended, at the very least, the best 'perceived' management teams have anecdotally created the most wealth for shareholders in this sector.

If you take a look at their actual team, their might not be a lot of first hand experience - but you'll walk away impressed with most of their resumes if you do the tiniest bit of digging.

I've tuned into tons of conference calls and I've walked away from CRON's impressed and better for it as an investor every single time. Again, this is based purely on my opinion and results - but I've made the most money in this sector first assessing if I trust the face of the company to sell their vision and execute.

I saw TRST riding a big wave last summer. I regretted not buying it as it went up, and up and up. I liked them.

Finally saw a buying opportunity. We were at $15, dropped to $11. I felt good. I bought. 

It was rocky for a while. Mostly downwards trend, but I thought ""hey, it's the season"".

Fins were coming up. People felt good, they were excited. I was going to sell the morning of, take my bit of profit and go.

Their Fins did not meet expectations, SP dropped. I held.

Then they sold their shares at 5.00usd. I said F U TRST and I sold all my shares at 6.80cdn.

Teppo27,"The headline of the MMEN PR today was about how they're getting an extra $30MM, but the part about the changed conversion prices is even bigger news. 

* Tranche 1 now converts at $2.55 rather than $3.29
* Tranche 2 and 3 now convert at the lesser of VWAP or $2.55 rather than the lesser of 115% VWAP or $7. 

This adds up to way more dilution than before. For example, if MMEN is at $6 and has a $6 VWAP when tranche 2 converts, the shares will now convert at $2.55, whereas before they would have converted at $6.90. So MMEN will have to give more than twice as many shares for the money than the previous deal.

Why did they agree to these revised terms? It can't possibly be because they want $280MM rather than $250MM, but more likely because they need tranche 2 right away. Why is this, when they just got tranche 1 not long ago and they are also selling shares on the open market?

1000100220012003,"Look. This sub is notorious for people expressing their opinions based on their moods. Obviously the timing couldn't be any worse since it's the summer downtrend. Now, no one knows what the  fuck is going to happen. The negative publicity that is happening right now doesn't help at all. Just like how hyping up a stock to bring the price up, going full bearish could also be profitable. Obviously, the sector is growing and many want to make a buck out of it. You have to be bullish as fuck as a company to make a name for yourself or else  you'll just be left behind the pack. Take WEED for example, they went from a 20$ stock to 3x that value by being aggressive.

TRST still have assests, a brand, an established position in the medical buisness and other things going for it. Unless the facility where they have grown ""illegal"" weed have subpar conditions, I don't see how this would actually impact the product's consumability or safety. If they could showcase that whatever they've grown follows the same standards of the ""legal"" or in simple terms approved stock, we're talking about purely bureaucratic garbage that don't deserve all this dark spotlight. Everything in this country takes shit ton of time when it's governement related which some serious pain in the ass. 

In reality, only time will reveal the repercussions of such acts. In my opinion, things are being blown way too out of proportion and media or whoever is behind this is absolutely going short on this. Doesnt even surprise me one bit that it's a low life employee who wanted to make some money who started this whole thing. Other than that, management won't drive their company to the floor, specially if it showed a promising future.
Product recalls do happen and while this could affect them just enough, it doesnt mean it's the end of TRST and that they can't get out of it just like OGI, APHA.

Like please. ""Illegal weed"" lmfao. Same facility, same company, same protocols, same everything. Everyone making it seem like they added cocaine to their strains and shipped it nationwide.

Ditto, same here.

And also, I definitely agree with having a good reason to keep holding - this isn't like the semi-effective short-term effects induced by the _externally-generated_ deliberate attacks on CRON, APHA, VFF, etc. - this is some severe shit coming from the _inside_ of TRST; they did this to _themselves_ and lost all credibility, maybe lost licensing, and could even face delisting, major management shakeups, etc.

That said, the company might not be completely _doomed_ per se, but it's gonna take a long... _looong_ time to recover from this. Very possibly years.

DrHarrisonLawrence,"I would chill with that anxiety, bud.  
  
Aphria’s daily share price is solely correlated to the amount of strangers buying shares vs selling shares. It’s current market valuation is solely correlated to the amount of money that has been poured into it and the value it’s created through maintaining the company’s assets alongside strangers buying shares on the open market.   
  
It is NOT correlated to any wrongdoing, malice, or illicit and/or illegal behavior. Their marketcap was technically lowered by $50 million due to an inaccurate valuation on one of their assets. Small (albeit, scalloped) potatoes.   
  
The fact that Aphria’s stock price isn’t artificially inflated similar to their peers (Canopy and Aurora) is because they have not received the same attention in the news by the average retail shareholder.

HoosierProud,Because this sector is news driven. Pretty much every company is currently overvalued based on current revenue. Big news like Constellations and Altria partnerings sent the sector into super bloated territory with insane valuations. The SP for many companies have come back to earth somewhat and with no major positive sector news there's nothing to drive everything back up. I don't foresee the whole sector having a solid bull run until there is a major news catalyst given most of these companies have future valuations. Everywhere else like SPY most of these companies have realistic valuations so it isn't surprising we're seeing gains.,1562822079.0,2019-07-11 18:04:36.701838,,False,ethonsk,False,t3_cblpht,t1_eth40ja,/r/weedstocks/comments/cblpht/rweedstocks_after_hours_discussion_july_10_2019/ethonsk/,1,False,weedstocks,t5_2zfqj

CrashKeyss,"In a situation like this they're not too great to sell at any point because if they lose their license you're going to be down 99% forever. Look at ASNT

Depends on if you're an investor or trader. As a trader, I'd think anytime you're down 10-20% you should sell out if you think it'll get worse, don't risk it any further than that. If you're a good trader it shouldn't ever get to that point though, but that trading level is above most of our expertise. As an investor you have a little more leeway, but this situation is pretty telling. The only positive news you can really get is that they're not COMPLETELY fucked, is that really positive news?

You just said ""obviously that's about to get way worse"" - why would you still hold if you assume that? Shit, if you're long on TRST for whatever reason you should exit out now and rebuy lower unless you're worried about long term vs short term gains tax. In the short term you're not going to see a net gain, but if you think you will in the long term my advice would be to selloff and rebuy lower and forget about the taxing of it. The 10% you might save with long term tax might be offset by you rebuying 10%+ lower, you know? Nobody knows where the bottom is or if it can recover - if we did we'd all be rich

Ask yourself this. Can bagholders deal with a third day of -10% and no positive news? Do the amount of people who want to play TRST thinking it will fully recover offset the people who want out? To me, they don't, and that's why I bailed and won't get back in. The company has a stink on it now far worse than any of the major players in the sector ever had (APHA) and while they can recover from it, they could also lose it all. It's a risk to play it or to hold it IMO.

60% loss sucks, but it's better than further loss. The 40% I had left is in cash being held for a good opportunity to invest that elsewhere and chip away at making that 60% back. If you believe in the company and their ability to rebuild from this then average down after you see some upwards movement. It won't go down forever if they don't lose their license, but it also won't go back up 60%+ by the end of the year with this scandal

Now if you're down 90%+? Then I guess you kind of have to hold because the cash you will generate is probably not much vs the chance it recovers some",1562813195.0,2019-07-11 18:04:36.702582,,1562813450.0,etheea3,False,t3_cblpht,t1_ethcwsi,/r/weedstocks/comments/cblpht/rweedstocks_after_hours_discussion_july_10_2019/etheea3/,4,False,weedstocks,t5_2zfqj

But why hammer folks who are already hurting?  Do you really think someone who just sold at a 60 percent loss appreciates your coming on here and saying I told you so!  Again, what was the intent of your hammering them?  Did it make you feel superior?

Why not say what you just said and provide some insight as to how you came to those conclusions and suggest how some can perhaps not fall in the same trap again?

Your first post strikes me as someone who kicks a person after they already lost a fight and is lying on the ground.

I stayed away from TRST due to the abrupt departure of some previous senior managers and that sketchy raise.  I learned the hard way through Aphria that if management is questionable so is the company.  But when some analysts (including Citron) came out supporting...you circle back and have another look.

I'm an investor from Ottawa, Canada since 2017.  Thanks for doing this.  I have 2 questions for you:

1) The first one is a hypothetical: If a recession similar to 2008 or worse were to hit tomorrow...and outside financing became limited, how self-sustainable would 1933 Industries be and what would be your gameplan?

What will you do to make reparations to the shareholders that paid the price (by holding through the millions of dollars in dilution)?  While I acknowledge it isn't fair for Brayden to profit off of the transaction and leave you to face the public backlash, many loyal shareholders feel sour and cheated.  This must be addressed.

Edit: Also, Brayden stated in the last AMA that Alternative Medicine Association's current facility would remain operational alongside the new 67,000 square foot cultivation facility.

1) Can you say anything about birdhouse skateboards and when we can expect to see some co branded SKU’s? And will these new products be available for sale in current retail locations where Birdhouse boards are sold?

2) Can you please go in detail about Infused MFG and the Product lines, how does each line sell compared to the total revenue? Do you see one product line standing out compared to the others?

3) I'm curious to know how the Cannafused line is doing where its available to be sold, Nevada and Colorado currently. Do you have plans to expand that to other legal states?

anditspottel,"I thought July 17th’ish was the conclusion date as well but believe this to be inaccurate. The problem is the Press Release issued by CannTrust on Monday is materially misleading. 

To provide some clarity: 

“In an email to MJBizDaily, Health Canada said CannTrust has 10 business days – until July 18 – to respond to the noncompliant inspection report.”

“In emailed responses to queries from MJBizDaily, CannTrust stressed that it will submit a report to Health Canada with “a root cause analysis” and steps the company is taking to address the findings.... “We don’t have the exact numbers yet while we complete our full investigation,” the company wrote”

I’ve been growing medically for myself for only 3- 4 years in living organic soil. I taught myself and I could out grow any LP for quality, taste, smell and pure organic. 

If they opened it up easier for people to grow smaller amounts but be able to sell the market would be flooded with high quality cannabis and no shortage. 

I grow for myself and work in marketing and sales. 
I would love to be able to grow my own to supply others and be able to go to the various stores to try and get my product on the shelf.  

The way it’s set up. 
- mass security needed
- huge facilities needed 
- licensing and approving through health Canada 
- packaging and restrictions

Given that one of the value propositions is that ancillary services are legal, what is KSHB's plan to stay competitive in an environment where larger established traditional companies, that benefit further from economies of scale & well developed supply chains (especially overseas in low labor cost countries) feel increasingly comfortable providing services to your customer base?

Kbarbs4421,"Congrats on solid Q3!  I continue to be impressed by your growth and corporate maturation, including promising fundamental trends.  In particular, I was happy to see gross margin continue to trend upward, reaching 18% this Q (a 6% improvement on previous Q).  As I recall, you've often stated on investor calls that your target for gross margin is 30%.  And you've been pretty confident that the company would reach this goal by FY20.  

* Is a consistent 30% gross margin still your target?  If so, in which quarter do you expect to reach this threshold?  What can we expect for margin in the interim?

* Aside from the impact of tarriffs (see below), what other major hurdles stand in the way of reaching this threshold?  What initiatives have you undertaken (or are planning to undertake) to continue the upward trend on margin?

* Is there potential for additional gross margin improvement beyond 30%?  Or do you see this as a reasonable percentage that you'd be happy to sustain going forward?  

* Finally, you noted in the past that the biggest drag on margin is the tarriffs on imported Chinese goods.  I assume this is still the case, since non-GAAP margin in Q3 was 23% (as opposed to 18% GAAP margin)?  If so, what does the continued presence of these tarriffs do to your gross margin target and the projected 2020 timeline?  Is 30% gross margin achievable with those in place?

Meadhead81,"Not to mention that as supply increases, demand lessens, which means the price lowers. This is one of the key points I've always stated against MSO's operating in vertically integrated non-competitive environments...

Those first 10 licenses might cost a million a piece because, well, there are only 10 and they are coveted. The state then gets addicted to tax revenue and decides to roll out another 90. Now your license that you paid 1 million for 18 months ago is is worth nearly 1/10 the cost which becomes a near 90% loss for the right to what?

peanutbuttercunt,There are a few companies that have the best in the state. Trulieve does indeed have top tier product along with Muv (private I think) Rise (green thumb) Vidacann (cresco). Trulieve however has the greatest variety which is the real reason they’ve maintained their 60% market share. Rise might be considered the best product (btw Trulieve hired their cannabis guy recently) but they had to move all flower product to their new store for its grand opening which wasn’t close to trulieve level of grand opening. That’s why I think it’s game over because while rise and Muv and others might be able to increase variety Trulieve is a step ahead of them with their buildout and brand awareness and will be able to double capacity and increase variety tremendously ahead of legalization many expect to happen in 2020 for Florida. Trulieve will be the only store really capable of handling the crowds with its 49 stores (15 more than competitors) and capitalize on the swarms of vacationers.,1562807868.0,2019-07-11 18:04:36.761729,,False,eth7ckv,False,t3_cbjtzj,t1_etgetkp,/r/weedstocks/comments/cbjtzj/florida_appeals_court_nixes_medical_marijuana/eth7ckv/,3,False,weedstocks,t5_2zfqj

Operators like Cresco seem more set and the merger made sense after I looked into it.

Hungston,"All labs have different testing protocols and different results when it comes to thc content and cannabinoid profiles. Until their is a nationally recognized testing protocol, I’m not sure comparing results tells you much.

Have you ever tested flowers at a lab? How about testing batches from rooms yielding hundreds of lbs? When you batch test you can have individual nuggets that test super high, but the sample average will usually be lower. As a company, obviously you promote how strong your flowers are because it’s great for marketing. However, I’m not sure people will justify paying an extra 15% tax for flower just because the state deems it’s over some arbitrary number.

It seems that most knowledgeable buyers don’t actually purchase flowers based on THC content, they prefer to purchase based on terpenes, bag appeal or “newness.” Luckily Illinois will have some years where the market gets educated and these products still demand a premium.

Also we are talking about one flower strain testing high when 99% of any states flower industry will test below 35%. To me this puts concentrates at a unfair disadvantage in this market and will cause people to resort to black market. (I.e - one guy buys a lb of flower at 10% tax rate and rosin presses it for his friends)

Another way to look at it is this: 20% is a good return on concentrates. Therefore 5g of flower = 1g of concentrate. You are going to have the option of purchasing 5g of flower for $50 at a 10% tax rate. Making the total $55. Alternately you can purchase a gram of concentrate for $60 ($10 more to cover the cost of extraction) which is then taxed at 25%. Making the total $75. This is a rough representation, but I think it makes it clear that rules like this are implemented to stunt certain parts of the industry. Usually parts of the industry that states don’t understand and/or are afraid of.",1562792180.0,2019-07-11 18:04:36.762271,,False,etgj88t,False,t3_cblbt5,t1_etgf6a9,/r/weedstocks/comments/cblbt5/illinois_is_going_to_tax_recreational_marijuana/etgj88t/,1,False,weedstocks,t5_2zfqj

AC1617,">Could the company lose its license and go under because of this? Sure, but I see that as unlikely.  

I agree, I don't see this being the case. A large fine is more likely but essentially shutting them down over jumping the gun on growing in rooms awaiting licenses? Doubt it.  

>What seems like the more likely ""bad"" result is it takes multiple years for them to fully recover and regain trust. Now, in this scenario, I still see it eventually recovering. Meaning that I wait to sell until some years down the road. **However, who knows if their competitors find ways to bury them during this recovery.**  

Bingo, that's why I say it's hard to consider them a long term play.
