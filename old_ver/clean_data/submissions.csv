I will be back on Friday at 2:30

PDT to answer your questions!

&#x200B;

It has been a few months since we introduced 1933 Industries to the Reddit community

and Brayden Sutton, former CEO of the company, did a great job answering all your

questions. I will endeavour to do the same. A little bit of background about myself, I have

been passionate about bringing organic wellness to people for years and started Infused

Manufacturing (Infused) with this goal in mind. I previously worked in cosmetic

manufacturing and took that knowledge into the cannabis industry. After much trial and

error, I personally developed the formulas for our Canna Hemp™ wellness line, which is

now sold across the US in over 800 retail outlets. Our products are actually improving

people’s lives and I couldn’t be more excited and proud! I was recently appointed CEO of

1933 Industries, overseeing the growth of this company. I am repositioning our business to

be brand-centric - in essence creating a true house of brands with assets to support it. Here

are some of the finer details about our company:

&#x200B;

We are a publicly traded issuer on the Canadian Securities Exchange and in the US on the

OTC’s premier tier QX (CSE:TGIF, OTCQX: TGIFF). Our assets are based in Las Vegas,

Nevada where we essentially own the market. As wholesalers of cannabis flower and

concentrates, our products are carried in all dispensaries in the Nevada market, owning

approx. 7% share of the market. Las Vegas is one of the largest recreational cannabis

markets in the world with approx. 45 million visitors per year. Our hemp-based, CBD

products can be shipped outside of state and this is where we see a huge growth

opportunity for our company. When we went public in 2017, both our THC and CBD assets

were small and constricted by our current infrastructure, which is why we undertook a

massive cultivation expansion project which is now ready. We are moving into a purpose-

built, almost 70,000 sq. ft. building, where we expect to achieve a 5x increase in cannabis

cultivation to provide the raw materials for our flower and branded concentrate lines sold

under the Alternative Medicine Association (AMA) name. Infused also moved into an

expanded warehouse to accommodate larger inventory and shipping across the US. Our

Canna Hemp™ brand is experiencing huge growth, which is directly attributed to the

superior quality of our products. We consistently receive rave reviews from third parties,

including industry professionals and customers and believe that our products are

disrupting the beauty and wellness sectors. As the public becomes knowledgeable about

the science behind CBD and hterpenes, we believe that this will be an explosive market. At

Canna Hemp™, we design products with specific demographics in mind. We have products

that aid in relieving everything from muscle aches and sores to nerve pain and migraines.

We developed a line for athletes, including CBD elixirs aimed at workout preparation and

recovery as well as our award winner and top seller Canna Hemp X™ cream for sore

muscles. In addition, we isolate specific terpenes and mixtures to achieve desired effects. In

total, we have over 200 products on both the CBD and THC sides that are available in the

market today and our portfolio is growing with the introduction of new products under

licensing agreements. We see the CBD market as a key component to our business and a

high-growth vertical.

&#x200B;

Last week we posted $4.6 million in our Q3 financial report for fiscal 2019. For the last nine

months ending April 2019, our revenues total almost $13 million. There are a number of

catalysts for our company over the next several months as we execute on an ambitious

growth plan. Our reach continues to grow in terms of both brand recognition, distribution

and sales with the ultimate goal of being a household name, synonymous with proven,

natural CBD wellness and consumer trust. We are working diligently in getting our hemp

extraction facility up and running by year’s end, adding another vertical to our business.

The new facility will process hemp biomass into CBD spectrum oils, distillates and isolates

and more importantly, we will be able to process additional cannabinoids such as CBG, CBC,

CBN, etc. Looking ahead, we will continue to scale up our assets, build the required

infrastructure to support our brands, continue to penetrate the US market with our Canna

Hemp™ portfolio, increase sales and margins, establish the hemp-processing and CBD

extraction vertical, and expand into new markets.

&#x200B;

I am here on /r/weedstocks to talk to investors focused on the cannabis sector about our

business and about the industry and will return to answer your questions on Friday, July

12 at 2:30pm PDT. I encourage you to post any questions in advance and I look forward to

With the addition  of LVV to its growing portfolio of Brand Partners, Flower One further  diversifies the cannabis offerings made available to Nevada's cannabis retailers and consumers. This marks LVV's first out-of-state expansion and entrance into Nevada.

""We are thrilled to announce West Coast cannabis brand,  La Vida Verde, as the newest addition to Flower One's portfolio of Brand  Partners, bringing their high-quality edibles to cannabis consumers and  retailers across Nevada,"" said Ken Villazor,  President and CEO of Flower One. ""With the Flower One greenhouse now in  a state of ongoing harvest, we are well positioned to accelerate La  Vida Verde's Nevada market entry while  employing our own proprietary techniques to ensure we're delivering the  high-quality products, together. Today's partnership further solidifies  our position as a leading cannabis cultivator and producer in Nevada, and allows us to further expand the product offerings made available in the state.""

""The La Vida Verde team and I are very excited and humbled at the opportunity to have our brand elevated and shared with the Nevada market – locals and tourists alike – through Flower One,"" said Bryce Berryessa, President and Co-Founder of La Vida Verde. ""After seeing the immense scale of Flower One's greenhouse facility in Nevada  and their application of commercial agriculture techniques to complex  crops, such as cannabis, we were not only reassured of their level of  sophistication, but excited to leverage their demonstrated ability to  meet our California-established  production and cultivation standards. We are entering this partnership  confident that the Flower One team will be able to execute on the La  Vida Verde vision.""

""La Vida Verde prides itself  on giving cannabis consumers healthy options when it comes to their  product of choice. Flower One's unique operational capabilities, using  industry-leading technology to produce high-quality, custom-packaged  cannabis at scale, will bring immense value to our brand and products,""  said Eric Hara, CEO of La Vida Verde.  ""Flower One is, without a doubt, a leading producer in the state, and in  leveraging their strategic operational approach and scale, we find  comfort in knowing that the supply and quality of La Vida Verde products  available in Nevada will be reliably and consistently delivered to our new consumer base.""

The  parent company of a holistic line of edible cannabis products, LVV's  organic, vegan, non-GMO and gluten-free products have been branded and  are available through its three in-house brands: La Vida Verde, Skunk  Feather™, and Blank Brand™. Later this summer, La Vida Verde will be  introducing its three cannabis tinctures (Relax, Restore, and Revive),  along with three gummy candies (Island Guava, Pineapple Butterscotch,  and Rootbeer Float) from Blank Brand™, in addition to a variety of  pre-rolls and packaged flower under its flagship brand Skunk Feather™.  Additional products under all three brands will roll out into the Nevada market before the close of 2019.

I am rookie investor that invested some playmoney into said companies. I was in MPX before it was acquired by IAN, thus I now am in IAN. APHA was adviced by a friend, I bought around 16 and 17 range, so im down on that one. Due to IAN's recent dip, I'm down there as well.   


On the other hand I have seen lots of news articles, partnerships and general good news pass through. APHA managed to survive GG's hostile take over attempt, yet seems to struggle to pass the 10 dollar mark atm.   


So: What would these companies need in order to preform like the more established cannabis companies like CGC, ACB and CRON? Or are these companies at such another level that you can't even compare? I believe CGC had a 2bln investment from Constellation, so that would help obviously.

My question is directed to the more technical experienced investors, but also basically anyone that wants to share his/her take.

Bruce Linton led Canopy Growth through the Business & geopolitical landscape of Canada.

Canopy Growth is now trying to navigate and conquer the most intense Business & Geopolitical Arenas in the World.

I hope seasoned investors and newcomers both find this post useful. I have been investing for over a year now and have learned a lot. I hope this post will help tame some people's expectations. Admittedly, my expectations were too high when I started investing in this sector (no pun intended). I wish I read a post like this a year ago. This post is for long-term investors, not day traders.

My general thesis is that there is far too much risk out there. Here's why:

1. Every single weedstock on the market right now is overpriced. Some stocks are VERY overpriced. Assuming that these companies will grow into/past their current valuation is NOT a given. Additionally, stock prices in this sector have been severely limited given the amount of dilution that has occurred with some companies. (Example: ACB).

2. There is a lot of uncertainty in the overall market. If the market goes south, weedstocks will be crushed.

3. Far too much foul play out there. Look at CannTrust, iAnthus, Aphria, etc. This is not the end of this type of bullshit, folks. (If you don't know what I'm referring to, please read up on these companies).

4. Completely nonsensical moves in stock prices. Example: Acreage. Company was essentially sold at 3.4B. It is currently valued at about half of that. Wtf? People who invested on this news have been buttfucked in the short term (let's see what happens long term).

5. It is very early days in this sector. No one knows how things will play out in the future. Many of these companies can very well be nonexistent in 5+ years.

6. It is very risk to believe some of the things written in this sub. Many people are pumping stocks that they know are trash (and are likely being paid to do this). Reading this sub will influence how you feel about certain companies/the overall sector. Do your own DD and make sure you really know what you're doing before putting a lot of money down. Make your decisions based on financial statements and other legitimate sources, not what some shmuck wrote in the Daily thread.

TLDR: Weedstocks are extremely risky given overpriced SPs, shady business practices, and uncertainty regarding how the industry will pan out. Make sure you check your expectations at the door.

Edit: Sorry if I sounded too dramatic. I am still long on several companies. I just think this sector is rife with BS. And for those of you commenting about my bags/losses: yes, I have bags and big losses. I also have some gains. I wrote this post because I do not want others to lose money the way I and many others have. My advice: do not over-allocate your portfolio in weedstocks, and pick only a few high-quality companies. Just my 2 cents.",False,False,weedstocks,Stop dumping money into weedstocks NOW,0.31,https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/cb8kt2/stop_dumping_money_into_weedstocks_now/
